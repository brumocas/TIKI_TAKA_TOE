# TikiTakaToe Game Repository

## Server Application (C++)

The Server application, implemented in C++, serves as the central hub for all TikiTakaToe game operations. It acts as the brain of the game, responsible for executing the game logic and managing connections from clients, providing a seamless remote gaming experience.

**Key Features:**
- **Game Logic Execution:** The Server runs the intricate TikiTakaToe game logic, ensuring fair and accurate gameplay for all connected clients.
- **Connection Management:** It handles the task of accepting and managing connections from clients, facilitating a smooth and responsive gaming experience.

## Client Application (Java)

The Client application, developed in Java, serves as the user interface that links players to the Server. With a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI), it enhances the overall gaming experience.

**Key Features:**
- **User-Friendly GUI:** JavaFX libraries are leveraged to create an intuitive and visually appealing graphical interface for players.
- **Connection Establishment:** The Client is responsible for establishing and maintaining connections with the Server, enabling players to seamlessly engage in remote TikiTakaToe games.

## Why Java and C++ together?

**Portability and Platform Independence:**
- *Java:* The choice of Java for the Client application ensures platform independence, allowing users to enjoy the game on various operating systems without modification.
- *C++:* The Server, implemented in C++, takes advantage of its performance benefits while still being deployable across different operating systems.

**Concurrency and Multi-Threading:**
- *Java:* Built-in support for multi-threading in Java aids in managing concurrent tasks on the client side, enhancing the responsiveness of the user interface.
- *C++:* Multi-threading capabilities in C++ are crucial for handling multiple game instances and efficiently managing server-side connections.

**User Interface Development:**
- *Java:* The Swing or JavaFX libraries simplify GUI development, making it easier to create an engaging and user-friendly interface for players.
- *C++:* While C++ has GUI libraries like Qt, Java's tools are more intuitive for developing client-side interfaces.

**Networking Capabilities:**
- *Java:* The `java.net` package facilitates straightforward network programming, ensuring seamless communication between the Client and Server.
- *C++:* Robust networking libraries, such as `<arpa/inet.h>`, are utilized on the server side to efficiently manage connections.

**Performance Considerations:**
- *C++:* Chosen for the Server application due to its performance benefits, as it is compiled to native machine code, providing optimal execution of game logic and connection management.
- *Java:* Although slightly slower in certain scenarios, Java's performance is generally good and is outweighed by its ease of development and platform independence for client applications.

**Integration and Component Compatibility:**
- The choice between Java and C++ is influenced by existing libraries or components, with C++ being historically popular in game development and Java being well-suited for client-side applications.

In summary, the combination of Java and C++ in this TikiTakaToe game repository represents a thoughtful and balanced approach, leveraging the strengths of each language to deliver a portable, performant, and user-friendly gaming experience for players.
